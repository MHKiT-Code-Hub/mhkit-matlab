function rotmat = calc_orientmat(adcpo)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%    Calculate the orientation matrix using the raw 
%    heading, pitch, roll values from the RDI binary file.
%     
% Parameters
% ------------
%    adcpo : The ADP object containing the data.
%
%    ## RDI-ADCP-MANUAL (Jan 08, section 5.6 page 18)
%    The internal tilt sensors do not measure exactly the same
%    pitch as a set of gimbals would (the roll is the same). Only in
%    the case of the internal pitch sensor being selected (EZxxx1xxx),
%    the measured pitch is modified using the following algorithm.
%
%        P = arctan[tan(Tilt1)*cos(Tilt2)]    (Equation 18)
%
%    Where: Tilt1 is the measured pitch from the internal sensor, and
%    Tilt2 is the measured roll from the internal sensor The raw pitch
%    (Tilt 1) is recorded in the variable leader. P is set to 0 if the
%    "use tilt" bit of the EX command is not set."""
%
% Returns
% ---------
%     rotmat: array 
%         orientation matrix

            % orientation, 180 degrees must be added to the measured
            % roll before it is used to calculate M. This is equivalent
            % to negating the first and third columns of M. R is set
