function omat = euler2orient(heading, pitch, roll, options)
    % For Nortek data only.
    % The heading, pitch, roll used here are from the Nortek binary files.
    %
    % Parameters
    % ------------
    %     heading: array
    %         Heading input is clockwise from North
    %     pitch: array
    %     roll: array
    %     units: string (optional)
    %         radians or degrees (default degrees)
    %         Whether heading, pitch, and roll are in degrees or radians.    
    % Returns
    % ---------
    %     omat: 
    %       a rotation matrix that rotates earth (ENU) -> inst.
    %       This is based on the Nortek `Transforms.m` file, available in
    %       the refs folder.
